# Spotube

Intend was to solve an issue with playlist on both YouTube and Spotify.
Had two issues one where friends who used one and not the other could not share playlists with each other.
The other being that if you used both you also had to make and keep up both playlists.

Solves the issue by pulling playlist data from either Spotify or YouTube. Then creates a playlist in the other platform for you.

Converts spotify to YouTube playlists and inverse
